# RougeUI

This is my **_personal_** UI for TBC-Classic. It is heavily inspired on a few elements from ModUI, LortiUI (black textures only) and SchakaPvPUI.

# **Feature List:**

- Blackened frames.
- Hide's all glows (resting/combat) and spamming inc damage indicators on player/pet/group portrait.
- Personal/Target (de)buffs can be re-sized + dispellable magic buffs can be highlighted on target/focus.
- Smooth animated Health and Mana bars.
- Sets the correct Player PvP icon when you get queued as Horde <> Alliance in a crossfaction battleground.
- Combat Indicator on Target and Focus frame.
- Added timers to target and focus castbars with a gradient effect + spelltext below.
- The nameplate's hidden castbar text is always shown.
- Fast keypresses can be enabled in settings (triggers spells on button down).
- Removed server names to show on raid frames when in BG/Arena.
- Class colored and/or gradient health bars can be enabled.
- Class portraits can be enabled.
- Built-in energy ticker for druids and rogues.
- PvP icons are faded by default for rogues and druids, because of CP overlap. In arena they are completely hidden for any class.
- Statusbar numeric text is shown as the _current_ HP/Mana. The numeric display can be shortened to one decimal.

# **BUGS:**

I have been using this addon for 2 years. There are no bugs or errors. If you do encounter any issue, then please refrain from opening a topic before disabling all other addons.

# **Credits:**

A lot of the code is kanged, ergo credits should be given where they are due: 
* Swagkhalifa: help with smooth animated bars + gradient castbar effect.
* Knall: for fixing the nameplate castbar hook C overflow and the combat indicator.
* Modernist for making the best addon hands down and inspiring me to bring over a few features from his 1.12 UI; energy ticker; spellbars; nameplates; smooth animated statusbars.
* Usoltev for the auras code.
* SchakaPvPUI (modded version as seen in Sbkzor's vids) for the inspiration.
* Lorti/Chordsy/Syiana for some of the copypasta. 
* Shanghi for his tbc 2.4.3 smooth animated bars fix.
* The rest not mentioned here :D

**Notes:**

The addon does not theme your buffs/debuffs or change them such as Lorti and ModUI do. I suggest using any of the following addons:
- Masque required: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/blizzbuffsfacade
- Raven: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/raven
